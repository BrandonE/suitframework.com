<p>[gettext]Well, sort of. You only need use the <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="execute" /]">execute</a> to use SUIT. It has multiple helper functions to make the system work, but you do not need to learn how to use them.[/gettext]</p>
<p>[gettext]However, even with two parameters, SUIT does a lot in it. You only need to provide the string you want to translate for "string", but "rules" takes a bit of work. See <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="rules" /]">Rules</a>[/gettext]</p>
<p>[gettext]Luckily, you do not necessarily need to learn how to create rules to program in SUIT. Our <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="download" /]#rulebox">Rulebox</a> provides several sets of rules to use. The <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" /]#templating">templating</a> ruleset should be enough to create sites with. If not, you can expand it by creating more rules or functions for it. See <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="rulesvsfunctions" /]">Rules vs. Functions</a>.[/gettext]</p>
