<p>[gettext]So, you got this far. What's next? Firstly, you need to decide whether or not SUIT is for you. To get a better idea of this, read a <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="comparison" /]">Comparison of SUIT to its Alternatives</a> and its <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="features" /]">Features</a>. Next, get an idea on how to read these docs through <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="readingdocs" /]">Reading Docs</a>.[/gettext]</p>

<p>[gettext]After that, you need to decide what aspects of SUIT you will be using. Are you going to merely be editing SUIT templates, or will you actually be developing sites with them? Will you use the <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="rules" /]">Rules</a> provided by SUIT, or will you be developing your own?[/gettext]</p>

<p>[gettext]Regardless of your goals, it'd probably be a great idea to start by reading the documentation for the <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" /]#templatingrules">Templating Rules</a> to get an idea of what potential rules can look like. If you are only modifying templates using this Ruleset, you probably can stop there. However, if you plan on developing sites to use SUIT, you should, at minimum, read the documentation for the <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="execute" /]">execute</a> function. You could read on related functions, but you can accomplish near everything just with execute. Lastly, if you want to learn how to develop Rules, read their <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="rules" /]#rulestructure">Structure</a> and their <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="rules" /]#paramsstructure">Params Structure</a>.[/gettext]</p>
