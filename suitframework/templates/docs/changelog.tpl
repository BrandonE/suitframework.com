<p>[gettext]07/31/2010: SUIT 2.0.1 and Rulebox 1.1.0 released. Applied the 80 character rule to the PHP files to match the Python files. Fixed bug with <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="try" /]">try</a> that caused the variable to be undefined initially if no exception was thrown. Made SUIT PHP's parse function cache correctly. Before, it was loading the cache, but not returning it. The static variable "delimiter" has been added to <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="call" /]">call</a> and <a href="[url controller="root" action="template" templatefile="docs" parameter1="transform" /]">transform</a>.[/gettext]</p>
