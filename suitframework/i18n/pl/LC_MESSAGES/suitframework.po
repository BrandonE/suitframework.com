This results in several languages on the same document, which can get <a href=\"[url controller=\"root\" action=\"template\" templatefile=\"docs\" parameter1=\"comparison\" ]\"/>very messy</a>, and forces all the developers to work on one file.

For instance, this site uses a function called \"pygments\" to highlight the code in our examples.
